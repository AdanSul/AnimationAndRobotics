## 📘 Assignments Overview   

### Assignment 1: Optimization and Visualization Basics  
Introduces **interactive optimization techniques** with real-time visualization. Explores gradient descent and Newton’s method for optimization, incorporating GUI-based **mouse interaction and dynamic plotting**. Compares optimization methods in terms of speed and convergence.  

### Assignment 2: Deformation (Mass-Spring Systems)  
Implements a **static mass-spring system** simulation to model **elastic deformations**. Focuses on the **finite element method (FEM)** for structural simulation, GUI interaction for pinning/moving vertices, and optimizing deformed states using energy minimization techniques.  

### Assignment 3: Kinematics  
Develops a **2D robotic arm simulator** with **inverse kinematics (IK)**. Implements both **Jacobian transpose (gradient descent) and Gauss-Newton (Jacobian inverse) methods** for solving IK. Explores **forward kinematics (FK)** and visualization of joint movements.  

### Assignment 4: Path Planning with RRT  
Implements the **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)** algorithm for **pathfinding in obstacle environments**. Builds an interactive GUI for defining obstacles, setting waypoints, and visualizing real-time tree expansion. Evaluates **collision detection, performance tuning, and path extraction**.
